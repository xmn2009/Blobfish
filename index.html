		<span id="drop">B</span>lobfish is a deep sea fish inhabits the coasts of Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand. It draws public attention when it was selected as <em>the World&apos;s Ugliest Animal</em> in 2013. You might know the reason with just a glimpse at the picture &dash; &quot; it looks like a big, blobby tadpole, just a mass of pale, jellylike flesh with puffy, loose skin, a big nose and beady, staring eyes.&quot;  Blobfish is a fish without muscles but primarily a gelatinous mass. It does not have a swim bladder like normal fish. With less dense than water, blobfish can float above the sea floor.

		The picture does not actually represent the real appearance of a living blobfish precisely.  Blobfish lives up to 3900 feet under the sea level and the pressure there is 60 to 120 times higher than ordinary sea level. In order to adapting to the high pressure in their living circumstance, blobfish develops no bones except a vertebra. This feature prevents them from being cracked in the deep sea, and also give them the &quot;ugly&quot; appearance, especially when they are out of water &dash; remember that they are mainly gelatinous mass without muscles.

		I hope this webpage can draw some attentions, not only because blobfish&apos;s &quot;attractive&quot; appearance, but also its living condition &dash; <strong>Blobfish is on the edge of extinction due to the collateral damage from deep sea fishing</strong>. They are usually caught while the fishermen catching other deep sea species, such as lobster, crab. Once they reach the surface of the sea, they will die quickly and develop into the melting looking due to the rapid change of pressure. And then, they are thrown away &dash; no one wants to eat a fish like that. Furthermore, this fish has not been fully studied yet. Though Blobfish is &quot;ugly&quot;, it deserves our attention like other protected animals.
